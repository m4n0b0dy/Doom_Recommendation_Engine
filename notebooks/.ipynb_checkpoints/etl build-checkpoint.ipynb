The death of Doody broke us in two We were thrown for a loop, aint none of us know what to do And at the time I was goin through my own struggles too So I wasnt in no condition to be coachin us through Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew I was hopin they do so I aint have to shoulder the crew The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew how to stand on they own, and I dont wanna open up wounds I just noticed the oomph was gone when we go in the booth Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died, so did the group Shoot   Turn to the river with you Help me leave this all behind  Ima wash away my sins Ima rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From that I pray that I dont fall Cause on the way back down I may end up runnin back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones  It was never the same, and its bothered me since And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets The more time goes by the more life happens And we gotta be men - we got responsibilities Plus we dont say how we feel and I feel like this is what got us in the debacle were in, been with you guys thick and thin But its almost as if sometimes were not even friends Which reminded me Biz, \"Rockstar\" was the shit Yall coulda got you a hit without me on the shit, if you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did more than try talkin you into comin up off of it I know it wasnt my fault, but part of it probably is I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with, maybe yall coulda clicked And got you some features, but thats water under the bridge But Im washin my sins in it til my conscience is cleansed    Bacardi and Henn, never thought the party would end One minute youre bodyin shit, but then your audience splits You can already sense the climate is starting to shift To these kids you no longer exist Went from rainin cats and dogs in this bitch, to tiny drops, little drips And by the time your reign/rain is over, youll hardly be missed/mist You start thinkin of all the artists you gift All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get for turnin your fuckin back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift A Freudian slip, subconsciously I honestly wished I aint feel so much guilt, and yall didnt harbor resentment But its hard to pretend that yall aint got none, I just wish I had words but I guess, theyre just, are none for this To my, partners I cant say how, sorry I am This is, not how I planned for our, story to end I love, all of you man but I just, cant be that guy every-body depends on for entire careers Cause thats, not even fair, I will, always be here But that spark isnt there, and I dont know how to recapture that time and that era, Ive tried harkening back to But Im fightin for air, Im barely charting myself Feels like Im on the descent, but it was not my intent to treat yall like a stepping stone Though I aint left no one behind but we been, down every road Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up But the longer we spend, livin this lie that we live The less is left for closure - so lets let this go Its not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over   I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones'}},\n",

       "     'verse': 'America!! Hahaha! We love you! How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold.. .. or so were told  I never woulda dreamed in a million years Id see so many motherfuckin people, who feel like me Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs Its like a fuckin ARMY marchin in back of me So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days Who woulda thought; standin in this mirror bleachin my hair with some peroxide, reachin for a t-shirt to wear that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this How could I predict my words would have an impact like this I mustve struck a chord with somebody up in the office Cause Congress keep tellin me, I aint causin nuthin but problems And now theyre sayin Im in trouble with the government - Im lovin it! I shoveled shit all my life, and now Im dumpin it on  White America! I could be one of your kids White America! Little Eric looks just like this White America! Erica loves my shit I go to TRL; look how many hugs I get!  Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself If they were brown Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf But Shadys cute, Shady knew Shadys dimples would help Make ladies swoon baby Look at my sales Lets do the math - if I was black, I woulda sold half I aint have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that But I could rap, so fuck school, Im too cool to go back Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin studios at When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up I was like Fuck it - until I met Dre, the only one to look past Gave me a chance aand I lit a FIRE up under his ass Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got Like damn; we just swapped - sittin back lookin at shit, wow Im like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now Its..   See the problem is, I speak to suburban kids who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist Whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss til I created so much motherfuckin turbulence! Straight out the tube, right into your living rooms I came And kids flipped, when they knew I was produced by Dre Thats all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in And they connected with me too because I looked like them Thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope Searchin with a fine tooth comb, its like this rope waitin to choke; tightenin around my throat Watchin me while I write this, like I dont like this All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working round the clock to try to stop my concerts early, surely Hip-Hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom So now Im catchin the flack from these activists when they raggin Actin like Im the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot, shit! Just look at me like Im your closest pal The posterchild, the motherfuckin spokesman now for..   So to the parents of America I am the derringer aimed at little Erica to attack her character The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress and piss on the lawns of the White House To burn the and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy Fuck you Ms. Cheney! Fuck you Tipper Gore! Fuck you with the free-est of speech this Divided States of Embarassment will allow me to have Fuck you!  Im just playin America, you know I love you'}},\n",
